/**
 * You are given a matrix with mm rows and nn columns of cells, each of which contains either 11 or 00.
 * Two cells are said to be connected if they are adjacent to each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
 * The connected and filled (i.e. cells that contain a 11) cells form a region. There may be several regions in the matrix.
 * Find the number of cells in the largest region in the matrix.
 * <p/>
 * Input Format
 * There will be three parts of t input:
 * The first line will contain mm, the number of rows in the matrix.
 * The second line will contain nn, the number of columns in the matrix.
 * This will be followed by the matrix grid: the list of numbers that make up the matrix.
 * <p/>
 * Output Format
 * Print the length of the largest region in the given matrix.
