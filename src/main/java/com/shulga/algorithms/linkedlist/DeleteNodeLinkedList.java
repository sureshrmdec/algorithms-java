/**
 Delete a given node in Linked List under given constraints
 Given a Singly Linked List, write a function to delete a given node. Your function must follow following constraints:
 1) It must accept pointer to the start node as first parameter and node to be deleted as second parameter i.e., pointer to head
 node is not global.
 2) It should not return pointer to the head node.
 3) It should not accept pointer to pointer to head node.

 You may assume that the Linked List never becomes empty.

 Let the function name be deleteNode(). In a straightforward implementation, the function needs to modify head pointer when
 the node to be deleted is first node. As discussed in previous post, when a function modifies the head pointer,
 the function must use one of the given approaches, we canâ€™t use any of those approaches here.
